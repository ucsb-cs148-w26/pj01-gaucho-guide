# Retrospective 02, February 13, 2026

* Led by: Ria
* Present: Ria, Tej, Nick, Anjali, Wendy, Krystelle
* Absent: None

## Action item

* **Goal:** Improve team coordination and visibility on individual progress during the sprint.
* **Change:** Each team member will post a short async update in the team channel or GitHub at least twice per week (what they worked on, what’s next, blockers).
* **Measurement:**

  * At least two updates per member each week
  * Fewer last-minute surprises before sprint deadlines
  * Faster identification and resolution of blockers

## Optional

* The team agreed that overall communication has been good, but more frequent lightweight updates will help keep everyone aligned.
* Members found that smaller PRs and earlier integration make collaboration smoother.
