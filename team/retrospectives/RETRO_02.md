# Retrospective 02, February 13, 2026

* Led by: Ria
* Present: Ria, Tej, Nick, Anjali, Wendy, Krystelle, Samuel
* Absent: None

## Action item

* **Goal:** Improve team coordination and visibility on individual progress during the sprint.
* **Change:** Each team member will post a short async update in the team channel or GitHub at least twice per week (what they worked on, what’s next, blockers).
* **Measurement:**

  * At least two updates per member each week
  * Fewer last-minute surprises before sprint deadlines
  * Faster identification and resolution of blockers

## Optional

* The team agreed that overall communication has been good, but more frequent lightweight updates will help keep everyone aligned.
* Members found that smaller PRs and earlier integration make collaboration smoother.

## Retro Assessment

**Process Used**
We followed a simple structured retrospective format: briefly discussed what went well, what could be improved, and identified one specific action item for the next sprint. The discussion was kept short and focused, with each team member given a chance to share input before agreeing on a team goal and measurable change.

**How It Went**
The retrospective went smoothly and everyone participated. The conversation stayed constructive and focused on practical improvements rather than problems. The team quickly reached agreement on improving progress visibility through more frequent async updates.

**Advice for the Next Retro Leader**
Keep the discussion time-boxed and focused on one clear improvement rather than too many changes. Encourage quick input from everyone so all voices are heard, and make sure the final action item is specific and measurable so the team can follow through.


## Experiment / Change

### Description  
The experiment is adding a short 10-minute async daily check-in using personal group chat. Each person posts what they worked on yesterday, what they plan to work on today, and if they’re blocked on anything. There are no meetings—just quick written updates.

---

### How it’s going  
This experiment is just starting. We’re watching to see if blockers come up earlier and if the team has a better sense of what everyone is working on day to day.

---

### Update (Wednesday, February 18, 2026)  
So far, the check-ins have been helpful. People are reading them, and a few blockers were shared earlier than usual. Instead of finding issues late in the week, we were able to talk through them the same day. It’s also been easier to see who’s working on what without extra meetings.

---

### Decision Going Forward  
Decision pending. We want to see if this continues to be useful over the next few weeks or starts to feel repetitive. For now, we’ll keep the daily check-ins and reflect on them each week.
