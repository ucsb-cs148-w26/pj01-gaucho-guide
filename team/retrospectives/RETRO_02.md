# Retrospective 02, February 13, 2026

* Led by: Ria
* Present: Ria, Tej, Nick, Anjali, Wendy, Krystelle
* Absent: None

## Action item

* **Goal:** Improve team coordination and visibility on individual progress during the sprint.
* **Change:** Each team member will post a short async update in the team channel or GitHub at least twice per week (what they worked on, what’s next, blockers).
* **Measurement:**

  * At least two updates per member each week
  * Fewer last-minute surprises before sprint deadlines
  * Faster identification and resolution of blockers

## Optional

* The team agreed that overall communication has been good, but more frequent lightweight updates will help keep everyone aligned.
* Members found that smaller PRs and earlier integration make collaboration smoother.

## Retro Assessment

**Process Used**
We followed a simple structured retrospective format: briefly discussed what went well, what could be improved, and identified one specific action item for the next sprint. The discussion was kept short and focused, with each team member given a chance to share input before agreeing on a team goal and measurable change.

**How It Went**
The retrospective went smoothly and everyone participated. The conversation stayed constructive and focused on practical improvements rather than problems. The team quickly reached agreement on improving progress visibility through more frequent async updates.

**Advice for the Next Retro Leader**
Keep the discussion time-boxed and focused on one clear improvement rather than too many changes. Encourage quick input from everyone so all voices are heard, and make sure the final action item is specific and measurable so the team can follow through.
