## Action item: Group Start, Stop, Continue Analysis

### Start
* Breaking things down into smaller chunks  
* Learning more tools  
* Documenting code more  
* Utilizing Kanban board more frequently  

### Stop
* Doing things without documenting them  
* Doing things out of order
* Not focusing on the big picture

### Continue
* Communicating well as a group  
* Having fun  
* Going to class  

## Retro Assessment

* The retro process that we used is Start, Stop, Continue. 
* This retro was helpful to our group because we were able to take a moment and analyze how we have been doing.  
* Based on what I learned today I think it's important to ask specific questions that people can answer.

## Experiment/Change

* Our change is going to be that everyone starts being assigned 3 tasks per week on the Kanban board. This will be done by splitting tasks up or introducing it more. 
* How its going 
* A decision going forward: keep the change, revert to previous procedure, make a new change?
