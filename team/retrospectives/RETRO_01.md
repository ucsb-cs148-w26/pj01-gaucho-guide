# Date of Retrospective: 01/23/26

* Led by: Anjali Dev  
* Present: Ria, Wendy, Nick, Krystelle, Samuel, Tej  
* Absent: n/a  

## Action Item

**Goal**  
Improve team organization and follow-through by making work clearer and easier to track.

**Change / Experiment**  
Each team member will be assigned **at least 1-2 tasks per week** on the Kanban board. Larger tasks will be broken down into smaller ones so progress is easier to see.

**Measurement**  
We will check the Kanban board weekly to see:
- if tasks are being updated regularly  
- if fewer tasks are left unfinished or unclear  
- if team members feel more aware of what others are working on  

## Start, Stop, Continue

### Start
- Breaking tasks into smaller, clearer chunks  
- Learning and using more tools as needed  
- Documenting code and decisions more consistently  
- Using the Kanban board more often  

### Stop
- Doing work without documenting it  
- Completing tasks out of order without communication  
- Losing sight of the overall goal when working on details  

### Continue
- Communicating openly as a group  
- Keeping meetings positive and collaborative  
- Attending class and staying engaged  

## Retro Assessment

The retro process we used was **Start, Stop, Continue**. Everyone reflected individually first, then shared their thoughts with the group. This worked well because it gave everyone a chance to speak and helped us notice patterns in what we are struggling with and what we are doing well.

This retro was helpful because it gave us time to pause and honestly look at how the sprint has been going. One thing I learned is that asking clear, specific questions helps people share more useful feedback. For the next retro leader, I would suggest making sure everyone talks and writing down common themes as the discussion happens.

## Experiment / Change

**Description**  
The experiment is assigning each person at least 1-2 tasks per week on the Kanban board, with tasks broken down clearly and documented.

**How it’s going**  
This experiment is just starting, so results are still in progress. Early signs will be tracked through Kanban updates and team check-ins.

*Update (Wednesday, January 28, 2026)* <br>
Progress has been good so far. Issues were assigned on Monday, and team members have been making steady progress. Some people, including me (Wendy), have already finished a couple of sub-issues, which is a good sign.

**Decision Going Forward**  
Decision pending. We will make a final decision after a few weeks on whether to keep this change, adjust it, or try something new. In the meantime, we will continue to update the experiment weekly and reflect on how it went each week.

*Update (Friday, January 30, 2026)* <br>
All issues assigned for this week’s MVP were finished. The experiment has been working well, since clear task assignments made it easier for everyone to stay focused and accountable. Breaking work into smaller, well-defined tasks helped the team make steady progress throughout the week and avoid last-minute confusion. Everything is on track and ready for the MVP freeze.
