## Team Agreements

These agreements guide how we make decisions as a team, especially around priorities, deadlines, and tradeoffs, using an Agile mindset.

### Commitment to the Team
- We agree to stay engaged and support each other throughout the project.
- If someone must miss a meeting for an unavoidable reason, they will notify the team on EdStem as early as possible.
- Team members who attend meetings will help share updates with anyone who was absent.

### Sprint-Based Planning
- We will plan work in short sprints with clear goals.
- Each sprint will focus on completing a small set of well-defined features.
- Sprint goals should be realistic and achievable within the given time.

### Quality vs. Scope Decisions
- Our priority is to deliver features that work well and are easy to understand.
- As sprint deadlines approach, we will evaluate progress honestly.
- If time is running out, we agree to reduce scope rather than rush unfinished features.
- Lower-priority or stretch features may be paused or dropped to protect quality.
- Choosing to stop work on a feature near a deadline is a valid and responsible decision.

### Adapting During the Sprint
- If a task turns out to be larger or harder than expected, we will communicate early.
- We will adjust sprint goals together rather than letting issues pile up.
- Changes to priorities should be discussed as a team.

### Shared Responsibility
- We share ownership of the project, not just individual tasks.
- We will help unblock each other when possible.
- Major decisions that affect deadlines or scope should involve the whole team.

### Reflection and Improvement
- At the end of each sprint, we will reflect on what went well and what did not.
- We will use those reflections to improve how we plan and work in future sprints.
- These agreements may evolve as the team learns what works best.

Our shared goal is to build a high-quality, useful project while working together in a way that is respectful, flexible, and realistic.
