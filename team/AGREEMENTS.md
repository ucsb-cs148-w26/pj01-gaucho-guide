## Team Agreements

We agree to follow these practices to create a productive, respectful, and supportive team environment throughout this project.

### Communication & Availability
- If one of us cannot attend a meeting for an unavoidable reason, we will notify the team on the EdStem channel as early as possible.
- We will try to keep absences to a minimum.
- Team members who attend meetings will help catch up anyone who missed by sharing notes, decisions, or updates.

### Collaboration & Contribution
- We will all make a genuine effort to contribute to the team’s success.
- We will complete our assigned tasks on time or communicate early if something is blocking us.
- We will respect each other’s time by coming prepared to meetings and staying engaged.

### Team Culture
- We aim to keep a supportive, respectful, and low-stress atmosphere.
- Questions are encouraged, and no one should feel bad for asking for help or clarification.
- We will listen to each other’s ideas and give feedback in a respectful way.

### Handling Challenges & Differences
- When disagreements or issues come up, we will address them calmly and directly.
- We will focus on solving the problem rather than blaming individuals.
- If needed, we will talk things through as a group and work toward a solution everyone can agree on.

### Planning & Work Style
- We will have a shared understanding of what we are working on and what our priorities are.
- Our process can change as we learn what works better for the team.
- We will regularly check in to make sure everyone feels supported and on track.

### Shared Goals
- Our goal is to build a useful, reliable project while learning how to work well as a team.
- Success means clear communication, steady progress, and a project we are proud of.
- We can count on each other to be honest, respectful, and committed.

These agreements may evolve as the project continues and as the team grows.
