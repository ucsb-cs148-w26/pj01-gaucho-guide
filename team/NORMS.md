# Team Norms

These norms describe how our team agrees to work together using an Agile mindset. They are meant to help us stay organized, communicate clearly, and keep steady progress throughout the project.

## Communication
- We communicate mainly through EdStem and respond within a reasonable time.
- If something is unclear, we ask questions early instead of guessing.
- We keep messages clear and to the point.

## Meetings
- We show up to meetings on time and come prepared.
- Meetings stay focused on progress, blockers, and next steps.
- If someone cannot attend, they let the team know ahead of time when possible.

## Planning & Work Flow
- We break work into small, manageable tasks.
- Tasks are assigned clearly so everyone knows what they are responsible for.
- We start tasks early to avoid last-minute stress.
- We update the team when tasks are completed or if blockers come up.

## Accountability
- Everyone is responsible for their own work.
- If someone is falling behind, they communicate early so the team can adjust.
- We follow through on what we agree to do.

## Collaboration
- We help each other when someone is stuck.
- Feedback is given respectfully and with the goal of improving the project.
- We review each other’s work when needed to maintain quality.

## Handling Issues
- Problems are addressed calmly and directly.
- We focus on fixing the issue, not blaming people.
- If needed, we talk things through as a team and decide together.

## Continuous Improvement
- We regularly reflect on what is working and what is not.
- We are open to adjusting our process as the project moves forward.
- These norms can change if the team agrees it will help us work better.

Our goal is to work as a reliable, respectful, and productive Agile team while building a project we are proud of.
