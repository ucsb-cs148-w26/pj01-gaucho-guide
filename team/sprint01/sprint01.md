## Sprint Goal
Make steady progress on the backend and data pipeline by stabilizing scrapers, starting core API work, and setting up basic local and web hosting where possible.

---

## Part 1: What will we do?

During sprint planning, we reviewed the backlog in priority order and discussed what we could realistically complete this sprint. After clarifying scope and expectations, the team committed to partial progress on several larger stories rather than full completion.

### Committed Stories
- Create API endpoints for backend (#20)
- Test and fine tune Reddit scraper (#27)
- Test and fine tune Rate My Professor scraper (#28)
- Hosting a chatbot interface on a local environment (#32)
- Code review Samuel’s API (#22)
- Host basic front end on a website (#21)
- Research different LLMs to use (#24)
- Research permissions regarding student transcripts (#26)

### The team agreed that the current scope is achievable within the remaining sprint time. However, the final number of sub-tasks may change as we gain a better understanding of their complexity and address knowledge gaps.

## Sprint Backlog Outcome
The sprint backlog reflects a reduced and realistic scope as of now. Larger stories are expected to continue into the next sprint. The product owner agreed not to add new stories during the sprint and will remain available to answer questions and clarify scope as needed.
