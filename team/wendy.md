Hello, my name is Wendy Contreras.

Some ideas I have for our project GauchoGuider, a chatbot trained on UCSB course data, is to gather information about UCSB courses, including descriptions, syllabuses, student opinions, and professor-specific insights. Since a course’s style and layout often depend on the professor, I want to organize the data by professor as well. I’m thinking we can pull data from sources like Reddit, RateMyProfessors, course syllabuses, and course evaluations if available.

Once we collect this data, the chatbot could answer questions like: “What’s the workload like for this class?” or “Which professor is recommended for this course?” I also think it could suggest courses based on student interests and past experiences, making it easier for students to plan their schedules. Overall, the goal is to create a tool that helps UCSB students navigate course options and make informed decisions, while learning from previous students’ experiences.
