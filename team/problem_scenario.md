# Problem Scenario: Finding Reliable Class Information at UCSB

Alex is a second-year UCSB student planning their schedule for the upcoming quarter. They want to choose classes that fit their academic goals, workload preferences, and schedule constraints.

To make this decision, Alex looks for information such as:
- Course descriptions and prerequisites
- Professor teaching styles and reputations
- Typical workload and difficulty
- Past student experiences and advice

Currently, this information is scattered across multiple sources: GOLD, department websites, Reddit threads, Discord servers, and informal word-of-mouth. Some information is outdated, incomplete, or contradictory, and it takes significant time and effort to piece together a clear picture of each class.

As registration approaches, Alex feels stressed and unsure whether they are making well-informed choices. They want a single, trustworthy place that brings together relevant class information and presents it in a clear, student-centered way so they can confidently plan their schedule.

The core problem is not a lack of information, but the difficulty of finding, synthesizing, and trusting it.
