# Problem Scenario: Finding Reliable Class Information at UCSB

A UCSB student is planning their schedule for the upcoming quarter. They want to choose classes that meet their academic requirements while also fitting their workload preferences and personal schedule.

To make these decisions, the student looks for information such as,

- Course descriptions and prerequisites
- Professor teaching styles and reputations
- Typical workload and difficulty
- Past student experiences and advice

Right now, this information is spread across multiple places such as GOLD, department websites, Reddit threads, and advice from friends. Much of it is incomplete, outdated, or inconsistent, which makes it hard to get a clear picture of what each class will actually be like.

As registration gets closer, the student starts to feel stressed and uncertain about their choices. Instead of feeling confident, they worry about picking classes that might be too overwhelming or not the right fit. The student wants a single, reliable place that brings all of this information together in a clear, student-centered way so they can plan their schedule with confidence and feel sure they made a well-informed decision.
