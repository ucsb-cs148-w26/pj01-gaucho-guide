## Priority 1 – Response Quality & Usefulness

We want to know if GauchoGuide is actually helping students find what they need.

**Feedback we want:**

* Are the answers relevant to your question?
* Do the responses provide enough detail?
* Did the information help you make a decision (housing, classes, professors, etc.)?

## Priority 2 – Information Sources (Reddit & Student Insights)

GauchoGuide uses student-generated content, and we want to know how valuable it is.

**Feedback we want:**

* Are Reddit-based insights helpful and trustworthy?
* Do you like seeing real student opinions?
* What other sources would you want included (e.g., official UCSB sites, RateMyProfessors, etc.)?

## Priority 3 – User Experience & Interface

We want to improve how easy and intuitive the product feels.

**Feedback we want:**

* Is it easy to ask questions and understand the responses?
* Was anything confusing or frustrating?
* What features would make you use GauchoGuide more often?

## Improvement Goal (Lab07)

### Objective
Improve system speed and ensure responses include useful student insights from Reddit and RateMyProfessors.

### Metrics

1. **Response Latency**
   - Average response time ≤ **3 seconds**
   - Peer testers run 5 queries and record response times.

2. **Data Coverage (Scraping Quality)**
   - At least **80% of course/professor queries** include:
     - Student perspective (Reddit-style insights), or
     - Professor/course details (difficulty, teaching style, sentiment).

3. **Usefulness**
   - Peer testers rate each response (1–5)
   - Average rating ≥ **4/5**

### How to Test

Peer teams:
- Run course and professor queries
- Record response time
- Rate usefulness
- Note if student insight or professor/course details were included
