# Overall Response to Reviewer Feedback

Below is our combined response to each section of the review form, along with concrete actions we plan to take as a team.

---

### 1. Feedback Based on USER_FEEDBACK_NEEDS.md (Custom Metrics)

The reviewers’ comments directly touched on **Perceived Trustworthiness**, which is one of our core supporting metrics. The suggestion to include citations or links to official UCSB sources (and even Reddit threads) confirms that trust is not just about correctness, but about transparency.

**Actions we’ll take:**
- Add lightweight source links when answers reference official UCSB policies, requirements, or course info.
- Explore clearly labeling informal sources (e.g., “based on student discussion”) versus official ones.
- Use this to improve trust scores without making responses too long or heavy.

### 2. Understanding of Product Features (and Likes / Improvements)

The reviewers clearly understood Gaucho Guider as an academic planning chatbot and reacted positively to the overall idea and feature set. The Chrome extension stood out as something they were excited about, even though it is not fully live yet.

They also pointed out small but real issues, like the profile username being stuck at `student@ucsb.edu`, which affects how “real” the product feels.

**Actions we’ll take:**
- Fix the profile username so it reflects the actual user and can be edited.
- Keep the Chrome extension as a high-priority feature since it clearly resonated.
- Continue sanity-checking that the core purpose (course planning help) is obvious to first-time users.

### 3. Effectiveness of the Product in Its Current State (UI/UX + Robustness)

Feedback here was mostly positive. One reviewer mentioned not encountering errors or inaccurate information, which supports our **Academic Question Resolution Rate** goal. That said, UI details like chat bar spacing and the top bar separation stood out as areas that slightly hurt the experience.

**Actions we’ll take:**
- Adjust chat input positioning so it feels more natural and closer to the bottom.
- Add clearer visual separation between the top bar and the main chat area.
- Continue testing edge cases to make sure the app stays stable as we add features.

### 4. Helpfulness of Deployment Instructions

The reviewers did not report any confusion or blockers during deployment. Based on that, we believe our `DEPLOYMENT.md` file was clear, straightforward, and easy to follow. Since no issues were brought up, the instructions appear to be doing their job at this stage.

**Actions we’ll take:**
- Keep the structure and clarity of the current `DEPLOYMENT.md`.
- As we add more features, make sure the instructions stay just as simple and direct.

### 5. Final Closing Thoughts from the Reviewers

What they liked most:
- Overall look and feel of the site
- The Chrome extension concept
- Stability and lack of obvious errors

Most impactful improvement opportunity:
- Increasing trust through sources and verification
- Small UI polish issues that affect first impressions

One more positive note:
- The app already feels solid and usable, even at this early stage

**Actions we’ll take:**
- Prioritize trust and UI polish before adding major new features.
- Add basic email verification checks to ensure only valid UCSB emails are used.
- Keep focusing on clarity, usefulness, and honesty in responses rather than trying to sound overly confident.
