# Gaucho Guider

## Project Description

Gaucho Guider is a combination of a chatbot, a web application, and a browser extension that helps UCSB students make better decisions when planning their courses. The chatbot will allow students to input things like their major, unofficial transcript, and whether they are on professional tracks such as pre-med or pre-law. Using UCSB’s academic requirements, Gaucho Guider can then help students understand what requirements they have left and generate a possible schedule based on factors like:

- how many units they want to take
- the workload they are comfortable with
- which courses best fit their academic path

We also plan to create a browser extension that works directly with UCSB GOLD. When a student hovers over a course, the extension will show helpful details such as:

- the general level of rigor of the course
- Rate My Professor ratings for the instructor
- access to past syllabi when available

In addition, the main web application will serve as a central place for UCSB-related resources. This includes things like old syllabi organized by course and professor, along with other tools and information designed to help students feel more confident and less stressed when choosing their classes.

The goal of this project is to simplify course planning by putting useful course information in one place and giving students clear, helpful answers.

# Audience and User Roles

## Ideal Users

Our ideal users are UCSB students who want more insight into future courses and an easier way to plan their schedules.

## User Types and Roles

All users are UCSB students, but they may differ in:
- Major  
- Year (freshman, sophomore, etc.)  
- Experience level (including prospective students)
  
Regardless of these differences, all users share the same role: gaining reliable, consolidated information to reduce the time and effort spent researching courses.

## What Users Can Do

All users have access to the same features and functionality. There are no separate user roles or permission levels; the experience is consistent for everyone, with personalization coming from the responses generated by the app.

## User Goals

Users want to:
- Understand courses better  
- Compare different class options  
- Plan their schedules with more confidence  

## How the App Helps

Gaucho Guider handles the heavy lifting by collecting and organizing course-related data and then delivering detailed, easy-to-understand responses. This removes the need for students to search across multiple platforms and sources, saving students time and effort.

# Technologies Used

- **FastAPI**  
- **OpenAI**  
- **Pinecone**  
- **Python**  
- **React**

## Why These Technologies

We used FastAPI in order to create the API for all of our calls. OpenAI will be used for the backbone of our course assistant. Pinecone to help achieve RAG implementation. Python and React for the frontend and backend, and for any scripts.

# Role and Permissions

Gaucho Guider will be available on the public internet, so we plan to restrict access to UCSB students using OAuth-based authentication (for example, requiring an @ucsb.edu login) to reduce the risk of spam or inappropriate use. All authenticated users share the same role and permissions: they can ask the chatbot questions and use the browser extension to get course-planning help, with no separate administrator or moderator features. Users’ goals are to understand courses more clearly, compare class options, and plan schedules with confidence.

# Project Paragraph

Gaucho Guider is a chatbot and browser extension designed to help UCSB students plan their courses and long-term academic paths more effectively. The application will provide an interactive chatbot interface where students can ask questions about classes, prerequisites, and scheduling, supported by a frontend that makes this information easy to explore. In addition to conversational queries, Gaucho Guider will include tools such as a prerequisite planner and a multi-year schedule planner to help students map out their four-year academic plan. The platform will also integrate a “gold lens” view that aggregates useful insights like grade distributions, Rate My Professor data, and key course details, giving students a clearer, data-informed perspective when comparing classes and making enrollment decisions.
