# Audience

## Ideal Users

Our ideal users are UCSB students who want more insight into future courses and an easier way to plan their schedules.

## User Types and Roles

All users are UCSB students, but they may differ in:
- Major  
- Year (freshman, sophomore, etc.)  
- Experience level (including prospective students)
  
Regardless of these differences, all users share the same role: gaining reliable, consolidated information to reduce the time and effort spent researching courses.

## What Users Can Do

All users have access to the same features and functionality. There are no separate user roles or permission levels; the experience is consistent for everyone, with personalization coming from the responses generated by the app.

## User Goals

Users want to:
- Understand courses better  
- Compare different class options  
- Plan their schedules with more confidence  

## How the App Helps

Gaucho Guider handles the heavy lifting by collecting and organizing course-related data and then delivering detailed, easy-to-understand responses. This removes the need for students to search across multiple platforms and sources, saving students time and effort.
