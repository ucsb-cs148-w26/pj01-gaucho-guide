# Audience and User Roles

## Ideal Users

Our ideal users are UCSB students who want more insight into future courses and an easier way to plan their schedules.

## User Types and Roles

All users are UCSB students, but they may differ in:
- Major  
- Year (freshman, sophomore, etc.)  
- Experience level (including prospective students)
  
Regardless of these differences, all users share the same role: gaining reliable, consolidated information to reduce the time and effort spent researching courses.

## What Users Can Do

All users have access to the same features and functionality. There are no separate user roles or permission levels; the experience is consistent for everyone, with personalization coming from the responses generated by the app.

## User Goals

Users want to:
- Understand courses better  
- Compare different class options  
- Plan their schedules with more confidence  

## How the App Helps

Gaucho Guider handles the heavy lifting by collecting and organizing course-related data and then delivering detailed, easy-to-understand responses. This removes the need for students to search across multiple platforms and sources, saving students time and effort.

# Technologies Used

- **FastAPI**  
- **OpenAI**  
- **Pinecone**  
- **Python**  
- **React**

## Why These Technologies

We used FastAPI in order to create the API for all of our calls. OpenAI will be used for the backbone of our course assistant. Pinecone to help achieve RAG implementation. Python and React for the frontend and backend, and for any scripts.

# Role and Permissions

Gaucho Guider will be available on the public internet, so we plan to restrict access to UCSB students using OAuth-based authentication (for example, requiring an @ucsb.edu login) to reduce the risk of spam or inappropriate use. All authenticated users share the same role and permissions: they can ask the chatbot questions and use the browser extension to get course-planning help, with no separate administrator or moderator features. Users’ goals are to understand courses more clearly, compare class options, and plan schedules with
