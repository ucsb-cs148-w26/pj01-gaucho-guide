# Gaucho Guider

## Project Description

Gaucho Guider is a combination of a chatbot, a web application, and a browser extension that helps UCSB students make better decisions when planning their courses. The chatbot will allow students to input things like their major, unofficial transcript, and whether they are on professional tracks such as pre-med or pre-law. Using UCSB’s academic requirements, Gaucho Guider can then help students understand what requirements they have left and generate a possible schedule based on factors like:

- how many units they want to take
- the workload they are comfortable with
- which courses best fit their academic path

In addition to the chatbot, we plan to include a **GOLD Lens browser extension** that works directly on the UCSB GOLD course registration site. Instead of switching between multiple tabs, students can hover over a course listing on GOLD and instantly see extra context, such as:

- the general level of rigor of the course
- grade distributions
- Rate My Professor ratings for the instructor

The goal of this project is to simplify course planning by putting useful course information in one place and giving students clear, helpful answers.

## TL;DR Description Summary

Gaucho Guider is a chatbot and browser extension designed to help UCSB students plan their courses and long-term academic paths more effectively. The application will provide an interactive chatbot interface where students can ask questions about classes, prerequisites, and scheduling, supported by a frontend that makes this information easy to explore. In addition to conversational queries, Gaucho Guider will include tools such as a prerequisite planner and a multi-year schedule planner to help students map out their four-year academic plan. The platform will also integrate a “gold lens” view that aggregates useful insights like grade distributions, Rate My Professor data, and key course details, giving students a clearer, data-informed perspective when comparing classes and making enrollment decisions.

# Audience and User Roles

## Ideal Users

Our ideal users are UCSB students who want more insight into future courses and an easier way to plan their schedules.

## User Types and Roles

All users are UCSB students, but they may differ in:
- Major  
- Year (freshman, sophomore, etc.)  
- Experience level (including prospective students)
  
Regardless of these differences, all users share the same role: gaining reliable, consolidated information to reduce the time and effort spent researching courses.

## What Users Can Do

All users have access to the same features and functionality. There are no separate user roles or permission levels; the experience is consistent for everyone, with personalization coming from the responses generated by the app.

## User Goals

Users want to:
- Understand courses better  
- Compare different class options  
- Plan their schedules with more confidence  

## How the App Helps

Gaucho Guider handles the heavy lifting by collecting and organizing course-related data and then delivering detailed, easy-to-understand responses. This removes the need for students to search across multiple platforms and sources, saving students time and effort.

# Technologies Used

- **FastAPI**  
- **OpenAI**  
- **Pinecone**  
- **Python**  
- **React**

## Why These Technologies

We used FastAPI in order to create the API for all of our calls. OpenAI will be used for the backbone of our course assistant. Pinecone to help achieve RAG implementation. Python and React for the frontend and backend, and for any scripts.

# Role and Permissions

Gaucho Guider will be available on the public internet, so we plan to restrict access to UCSB students using OAuth-based authentication (for example, requiring an @ucsb.edu login) to reduce the risk of spam or inappropriate use. All authenticated users share the same role and permissions: they can ask the chatbot questions and use the browser extension to get course-planning help, with no separate administrator or moderator features. Users’ goals are to understand courses more clearly, compare class options, and plan schedules with confidence.


# Installation

## Prerequisites

For normal use, GauchoGuider is a web application and only requires:

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)

No local installation is required to use the deployed version.

If you want to run the project locally for development, you will need:

- Git
- Python 3.10+
- Node.js
- Ollama installed locally
- A Pinecone account with an API key

## Dependencies

### Backend

- **Python** – Main backend language
- **FastAPI** – API layer for handling requests
- **LangChain / LangChain-Ollama** – Connects the app to the local LLM and manages prompts
- **Ollama (Llama 3.1)** – Runs the language model locally (NOTE: For right now. We are working to use Gemini instead.)
- **Pinecone** – Stores and retrieves vector embeddings for RAG
- **Click** – Handles CLI input and output
- **python-dotenv** – Loads environment variables such as API keys

### Frontend

- **React** – Builds the user interface
- **Vite** – Frontend development and bundling

## Installation Steps

### Hosted Version

Since GauchoGuider is a web application, users can access it directly using the deployed link provided in the project.

### Local Setup

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd gauchoguider
```

Set up a virtual environment and install backend dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a .env file and add your Pinecone API key:

```bash
PINECONE_API_KEY="your-pinecone-api-key"
```

Install the local language model:
```bash
ollama pull llama3.1
```
Start the backend:
```bash
python main.py
```
Start the frontend:
```bash
cd chatbotWeb/chatBotWeb
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open the app in your browser at:
```bash
http://localhost:5173
```

### Functionality:

GauchoGuider helps UCSB students make course-planning decisions by letting them ask questions in plain English.

Typical use cases include:

- Asking about a course to understand its focus and workload
- Asking about a professor to see general teaching style and student feedback
- Asking campus-related questions tied to UCSB student life

The app combines scraped data with AI-generated responses to give quick, easy-to-understand guidance for scheduling and planning.

### Known Problems

- Only the RateMyProfessors scraper is fully implemented. Reddit and UCSB catalog scrapers are still in development.
- Some questions may return limited or missing answers due to the current data coverage.
- In some cases, the system will explicitly tell the user that it does not have enough information to answer a question.
- The model does not always correctly identify whether a question is about a course, a professor, or general campus life, which can affect response quality.
- The assistant currently uses a very casual tone. We plan to fine-tune this so it sounds more balanced—friendly and conversational, but not overly informal.
